# VALENCE ANNOTATION GUIDELINE


Lucia Chen

## Definitions 

**PRIMARY TARGET OF OPINION (PTO)**: This is the entity towards which we can determine the speaker's attitude. The entity can be a person, situation or event. *There could be more than one PTOs in one sentence or one post.*

**VALENCE** refers to the degree of positivity or negativity of the post as it relates to the primary target of opinion. 

## The Task  

In this task, you need to identify the valence of the post. Valence can be positive, negative, mixed (both positivity and negativity) or neutral. 

If the post indicates positive valence only, choose "Positive". 

If the post indicates negative valence only, choose "Negative".

If the post indicates both positive and negative valence, choose "Mixed".

If the post does not indicate any valence, choose "Neutral".

If you cannot understand the post because the languge is confusing or there's a large trunk of foreign language that you don't understand, choose "Cannot understand the post".


Valence is determined as follows: 

* If the author expresses positive or negative attitudes towards the primary target of opinion, or positive / negative emotions, then the author's attitude / emotions correspond to the valence of the post. Examples:

  * Positive: I am *very proud* / I *love* going for a walk in the rain. / I had pasta today ;) 
  * Negative: I am *so sad*. / I *hate* waking up so early this morning. / I had pasta today :(
  * Mixed: I am *so proud* to start a new chapter in my life, but *really sad* to leave my hometown. 
  * Mixed: I like the movie, but the conversation between Tom and Jack makes me feel a bit sad. 
  * Neutral: I had pasta today.

* If the author does not express any positive or negative attitude using obvious valenced words (e.g. adjectives, emoji, verbs), but the primary target of opinion has strong associations with positive or negative valence. These words usually have valence as part of their meanings, for example, *die*, *nuisance*, *disgusting* (negative) or *cherish*, *blessing*, *wonderful* (positive).  In that case, use these associations to determine valence. Consider the valence that the primary target of opinion has for most people in Western culture. 

  Don't over interpret the valence of the primary target of opinion, just go with your primary intuition. If you need a second thought to identify whether it might be positive or negative, or when there are multiple possible interpretations, label it as neutral.

  + If the primary target of opinion is usually associated with a lack of reward, threat, fear, anxiety, loss, anger, annoyance, or  other negative emotions, label the post as negative. Examples:

      * I did not win the race. (no reward)
      * My cat died. (death has strong negative associations)
      * When will politicians learn to govern? (rhetorical question indicates frustration) 
      * The wildfires have displaced thousands of people. (losing one's home is associated with negative emotions)

  + If the primary target of opinion is usually associated with a reward, success, accomplishments, or other positive emotions, label the post as positive. Examples: 

     * I finished all the assignments on time. (accomplishment)
     * I got an A on my exam. (reward)
     * My grandmother gave me a pretty necklace. (reward, indication of positive assessment of necklace)
     * We need a diplomat like him. (We can infer that the speaker has a positive attitude towards the person.)

As you have seen, valence can be represented by any word form or phrase. This includes nouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and even emoticons. 

## What to do if you are not sure about the valence? 

If there are any posts where you are not sure about the correct valence, go with the option that makes the most sense to you, copy and paste the post into a separate document, and describe the reasons why you found your decision difficult. This is particularly important for the first 60 posts you label. 

## What if the post is not interpretable?
Sometimes the posts might contain one or two foreign words, but that might not affect your interpretation of the post if there's enough context information. However, sometimes the posts contain a trunk of foreign language that affects your interpretation, choose *Cannot understand the post*.

1. I was not sure how to annotate this one as there are two things the post mentions – the film and Israel-Palestine conflict – but the primary target of the opinion is the film. 

Answer: When there are two or more potential primary targets of opinion in a post, and the author expresses different attitudes towards both targets, please choose *Mixed*. 



	
	Example:
	- you might frequently flip-flop between seeing yourself as a remarkable success or a major failure based on the praise or criticism of others. 

	- A person with dichotomous thinking may meet a new coworker at work. In the beginning, the coworker is viewed as amazing, perfect, and better than any other coworker or friend ever encountered before. People with dichotomous thinking tend to have favorites and to believe that everything about a favorite person or thing is superior to others. However, as time goes on, someone with dichotomous thinking may suddenly swing to the opposite extreme. If ignored by the coworker, or if the co-worker behaves in a disappointing way, a person with dichotomous thinking may lose respect for or hate this formerly favorite coworker, unable to sustain relationships that are not distinctly "love" or "hate". 		
		
					
*  **Disqualifying the Positive** Denying a situation/trait/event is positive.
	
	Example: 
	- The imposter syndrome 

	- A friend compliments you on a dinner you made, but you decide that “they are just saying that to be nice” or “they are trying to get something out of me”.
						
*  **Emotional Reasoning** Letting your emotions to direct your conclusions about yourself, others, or situations. 


	Example:
	- You can’t help feeling fat, though your doctor and those around you tell you that your weight lies comfortably within the normal range. You actually know this, and still…

	- You feel guilty about something, so you conclude you must be guilty—even though there’s absolutely no evidence that you’ve done anything wrong and others have assured you of this.

	- In your relationship, you struggle mightily with feelings of jealousy. You can’t resist accusing your partner of infidelity, even though they’ve shown nothing but devotion to you and you have no plausible evidence that you've been betrayed.

	- You feel stupid, so you’re convinced you must be dumb, regardless of the fact that your grades in school were as good as (or better than!) others and, as an adult, you’ve achieved at least as much as those around you.

	- You feel enraged with someone, so you take for granted that they must have done something bad, though you really can’t put your finger on anything specific and nothing about their behavior seems to provoke anyone else.

	- You feel lonely so you’re compelled to deduce that no one cares about you, that your feeling unequivocally confirms your unlovability.

					
* **Externalization of Self-Worth** Develop one's self-worth only based on how the external world views one.

	Example: 
	- My worth is dependent on what others think of me.

	- If I don’t do that, people won’t like me anymore.
						
* **Fortunetelling**  Assume that some event or events will end badly for us, that we will fail at something or we will be in danger, more as an assumption rather than an educated guess. *Sometimes it's difficult for us to judge whether the statement is supported by evidence or not based on Facebook text only. In this case, if the author did not provide evidence in the text, we flag the post as cognitive distortion*

	Example: 
	- I’ll never, ever feel better.

	- I’m not going to get the job.

						
* **Labeling** Labeling oneself or others using derogatory names.

	Example: 
	- I’m a loser.
	- I failed a test, I am a failure.	
	- she is frequently late to work, she is irresponsible. 
				
* **Magnification** Exaggerate the importance of your errors, fears, and imperfections. 

	Example: 
	- Yon send out the wrong letter to a client at work, and this turns into “I will now lose my job, and then I won’t be able to pay my bills, and then I will lose my house.” 

*Note: Catastrophizing is a subtype of Magnification.*
							
* **Mind Reading** Concluding that other people are reacting negatively, or thinking negatively toward him/her, without evidence to support the conclusion. 

	Example: 
	- I just know that he/she will disapprove.

*Sometimes it's difficult for us to judge whether the statement is true to the reality based on Facebook text only. In this case, if the author did not provide evidence in the text, we flag the post as cognitive distortion*
						
* **Minimization** Minimizing or discounting the importance of some event, trait, or circumstance. Note: Similar to Disqualifying the Positive, minimization emphasis discounting the IMPORTANCE of something, not whether it is positive
	
	Example: 
	- People tell you that you have done a good job but you are still anxious that it's not good enough
	- What I say doesn’t matter anyway, my opinion is not important to the group.
						
* **Overgeneralization** When someone over generalizes, they see that one negative event in their life as a never ending pattern. People with overgeneralization thinking patterns tend to use “always”, “every” and “never” very often.

	Example :
	- Why does this always happen to me?	

	- It doesn’t matter what my choices are, they always fall flat.

	- Nothing good ever happens to me.
	
	- Everything is always terrible.

* **Perfectionism** Constantly striving to live up to some internal or external standards of perfection without evalutating whether the goal is realistic or not.

	Example: 
	- Doing a merely adequate job is just a failure.
						
* **Personalization** Assume you are responsible for an external event over which you have no control. When you personalize, you feel guilty because you confuse influence with control over others. 

	Example: 
	- My daughter failed her exam. I should have done more to help her.

						
* **Selective Abstraction** The process of exclusively focusing on one negative aspect or detail of a situation, magnifying the importance of that detail, thereby casting the whole situation in a negative context. 

	Example:
	- I hate school.
	
	*We don't know what happen to this person in school, but usually there are ups and downs. Some people often assign positive meanings to daily life events, whereas, some people magnify the negativity of one event.*
	
	*Note: The difference between disqualifying of positive and selective abstraction is that the former one denies a positive event or positive trait, whereas, selective abstraction focus on negative aspects of the event*
						
* **“Should” Statements** A pattern of having internal expectations or demands on oneself, without whether it's reasonable to have these expectations or not.

	Example: 
	- I shouldn’t have made so many mistakes.
